## 🎨 Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/React

- Use TypeScript for all new files

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the existing color scheme
- Maintain responsive design
- Use the `cn()` utility for conditional classes

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (`BasicStats.tsx`)

## 📦 Adding New Video Scenes

1. Create scene in `src/scenes/YourScene.tsx`
2. Add proper TypeScript types
3. Include AshrafMorningstar credit comment
4. Register in `src/remotion/index.ts`
5. Update README.md with scene description
6. Test in Remotion Studio

Example scene template:

```tsx
/**
 * Created by AshrafMorningstar
 * https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar
 */
import React from "react";
import { AbsoluteFill } from "remotion";

export const YourScene: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill className="bg-slate-950">{/* Your content */}</AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

## 🎬 Video Scene Guidelines

- **Duration**: 5-10 seconds (150-300 frames at 30fps)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- **Performance**: Optimize for smooth 30fps playback
- **Accessibility**: Use readable fonts and contrast
- **Branding**: Maintain the violet/cyan color scheme

3. **Fix the bug**
4. **Verify the test passes**
5. **Check for regressions**

## 💡 Feature Development Guidelines
